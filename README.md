# SvelteKit authentication wit cookies

This example was made from the awesome tutorial series from
@huntabyte.

This uses Pocketbase with SvelteKit and DaisyUI

To get set up with a Pocketbase database I used the guide from here:

For the mail service I'm using https://www.sendinblue.com/

If you like using Prisma there's also a really good series from
@mattcroat.
